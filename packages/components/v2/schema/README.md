# Schema v2 <Badge text="under development" type="error"/>

## Description
Taking into consideration needs from multiple stakeholders the schema is being redesigned.

Stakeholders:

1. the need for a National commitments authorized by party via the chm.cbd.int
2. input from multiple SCBD programmes
3. potential partner needs
4. machine learning modeling (which could)->  auto link targets and categorisations, AI based vetting, assist in auto acquiring commitments, make predictions, auto link related material
5. interoperability that goes beyond manually tieing systems together

This repository package will hold the base schema to validate commitments, actions, organizations and other related information to commitments.  The schema will be in https://json-schema.org/ format.  Then validated against <a href="https://schema.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <OutboundLink/> https://schema.org/ </a> and <a href="https://bioschemas.org/groups/Biodiversity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><OutboundLink/> Biodiversity schema.org </a>.   <a href="https://schema.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <OutboundLink/> https://schema.org/ </a> was chosen being the <a href="http://webdatacommons.org/structureddata/2019-12/stats/stats.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <OutboundLink/> most popular machine vocabulary used</a>.  This will allow for further translation to other machine vocabularies and assist in machine learning modeling.

Further, offering data <a href="https://schema.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <OutboundLink/> https://schema.org/ </a> format will aid in SEO and help major search engine visibility for commitments portals while avoiding duplicate content issues with respect indexing on major search engines.
