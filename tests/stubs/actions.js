      linkagesDescription: 'By 2020, at the latest, incentives, including subsidies, harmful to biodiversity are eliminated, phased out or reformed in order to minimize or avoid negative impacts, and positive incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity are developed and applied, consistent and in harmony with the Convention and other relevant international obligations, taking into account national socio economic conditions.',
      progressMeasured: `Biodiversity is defined and measured as an attribute that has two components — richness and evenness. Richness = The number of groups of genetically or functionally related individuals. In most vegetation surveys, richness is expressed as the number of species and is usually called species richness.`,
